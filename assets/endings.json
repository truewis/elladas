    "Mr. Prime Minister, the Patriarch of Constantinople has called for a national fast and prayer ahead of tomorrow's emergency vote. Clergy are openly calling for a new form of government.",

    "answer":
    "Mother of God!",

    "ending":
    "It was Sunday morning, and bells tolled across Ellada, not just from church towers, but from loudspeakers placed in town squares and ministry courtyards. The Prime Minister had resigned hours earlier, handing authority to a transitional council led jointly by senior clergy and a group of sympathetic MPs. Parliament, now emptied of secular parties, had already drafted amendments redefining the Hellenic Republic as the Orthodox State of Ellada. Some celebrated in the streets, kissing icons and chanting hymns. Others watched in stunned silence, unsure whether to mourn or pray."

    "question":
    "Dear Prime Minister, you have been in power for such a long time. You are, in fact, one of the longest-living prime ministers in the history of the republic. That is an impressive achievement, but no human lives forever. Would you like to pick your successor?",

    "answer":
    "Time flies by...",

    "ending":
    "The Prime Minister had formally stepped down the day before, choosing not to seek another term after a full tenure. In his farewell address, he thanked the Greek people and emphasized the need for continuity and calm. There were no mass demonstrations, no crisis, just the soft murmur of politics moving forward. As Athens settled into a warm spring day, a sense of cautious optimism lingered in the air. Change was coming, but for once, it wasn't arriving in chaos."

    "question":"Dear Prime Minister, Syntagma Square is full of angry people! This protest is unlike the past ones.",
    "answer": "Ha! We'll see.",
    "ending": "The prime minister, who blatantly ignored human rights and democratic institutions, is no more. At government ministries, staffers whispered and moved briskly. Phones rang off the hook. Foreign embassies issued measured statements of concern and support for democratic stability. Markets wavered. European leaders scheduled emergency meetings. The president, now the interim head of state, called for unity. But for everyday Greeks, it was a strange mix of relief, unease, and grim satisfaction."

    "question":"Dear Prime Minister, people are now convinced that you are destroying the history of this country. Scholars all over the world have filed a petition against your government's revisionist views.",
    "answer": "But this is what the people wanted.",
    "ending": "Obsession to the past has set back this country for too long. Now, amphitheaters are rebranded to shopping complexes, and ancient sanctuaries are paved over for high-speed transit hubs. Resistances were short-lived, and even them were eventually given what they really wanted: prosperity. For a generation raised without ruins, their identity will no longer reside in the obsolete past but in the glorious future that will unfold in front of their eyes."

    "question":"Dear Prime Minister, the European Central Bank seems to have lost the last bit of its patience. And our people would rather die than to accept their conditions.",
    "answer": "It's not my fault...",
    "ending": "The constant government overspending was not sustainable. Markets had already crashed. The eurozone had frozen Greece's accounts after last-ditch talks collapsed over pension cuts and tax hikes. The IMF walked away. The ECB refused emergency liquidity. Berlin was stern. The Prime Minister's resignation had come at midnight. Ellada and its people will eventually survive the turmoil as they have many times before, but the same cannot be said for the prime minister. People will remember you as a single person who is responsible for their hardships."

    "answer": "Regressive assholes...",
    "ending": "It was Sunday morning, and bells tolled across Ellada both in celebration and in protest. The ruling party had been defeated by the largest margin in the history of the republic. In backlash to the Prime Minister's recent blatant insult toward the Orthodox Church, right-wing parties, supported by religious fundamentalists, rose to power. Secular reformists hoped to modernize Ellada. But instead, they reminded it of what it refuses to let go. "
