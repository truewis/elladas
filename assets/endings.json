    "It was Sunday morning, and bells tolled across Greece, not just from church towers, but from loudspeakers placed in town squares and ministry courtyards. The Prime Minister had resigned hours earlier, handing authority to a transitional council led jointly by senior clergy and a group of sympathetic MPs. Parliament, now emptied of secular parties, had already drafted amendments redefining the Hellenic Republic as the Orthodox State of Greece. Some celebrated in the streets, kissing icons and chanting hymns. Others watched in stunned silence, unsure whether to mourn or pray."

    "Dear Prime Minister, you have been in power for such a long time. Would you like to pick your successor?",

    "answer":

    "ending":
    "The Prime Minister had formally stepped down the day before, choosing not to seek another term after a full tenure. In his farewell address, he thanked the Greek people and emphasized the need for continuity and calm. There were no mass demonstrations, no crisis, just the soft murmur of politics moving forward. As Athens settled into a warm spring day, a sense of cautious optimism lingered in the air. Change was coming, but for once, it wasn't arriving in chaos."

    "question":"Dear Prime Minister, Syntagma Square is full of angry people! This protest is unlike the past ones.",
    "answer": "Ha! We'll see.",
    "ending": "The prime minister, who once plotted to completely dismantle the national identity of Hellas, is no more. At government ministries, staffers whispered and moved briskly. Phones rang off the hook. Foreign embassies issued measured statements of concern and support for democratic stability. Markets wavered. European leaders scheduled emergency meetings. The president, now the interim head of state, called for unity. But for everyday Greeks, it was a strange mix of relief, unease, and grim satisfaction."

    "answer": "It's not my fault...",
    "ending": "Markets had already crashed. The eurozone had frozen Greece's accounts after last-ditch talks collapsed over pension cuts and tax hikes. The IMF walked away. The ECB refused emergency liquidity. Berlin was stern. Washington was sympathetic. The Prime Minister's resignation had come at midnight. Greece and its people will eventually survive the turmoil as they have many times before, but the same cannot be said for the prime minister."

    "answer": "Regressive assholes...",
    "ending": "It was Sunday morning, and bells tolled across Greece both in celebration and in protest. The ruling party had been defeated by the largest margin in the history of the republic. In backlash to the Prime Minister's recent blatant insult toward the Orthodox Church, right-wing parties, supported by religious fundamentalists, rose to power. Secular reformists hoped to modernize Greece. But instead, they reminded it of what it refuses to let go. "
